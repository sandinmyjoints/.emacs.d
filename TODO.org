  - https://gist.github.com/mads379/907245
  - trying: ctags -e -R --exclude=*.js --exclude=node_modules .
    but it doesn't do coffee, despite putting coffee definitions in .ctags and .etags
  - this command worked:
ctags -e -R --exclude=*.js --exclude=node_modules --exclude=local_notes \
--langdef=coffee \
--langmap=coffee:.coffee \
--regex-coffee="/^class ([A-Za-z.]+)( extends [A-Za-z.]+)?$/\1/c,class/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*@?([A-Za-z.]+):.*[-=]>.*$/\1/f,function/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=.*[-=]>.*$/\1/f,function/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=[^->\n]*$/\1/v,variable/" \
.

  - but only sort of. the definitions don't really work across modules and such.

* TODO Emacs golf

* TODO Master regexp syntax
* TODO coffee-mode coffee-dedent-line-backspace-ignore-blank that does nothing on blank lines

  - useful for set-rectangular-region-anchor

* TODO Sometimes C-p and C-n skip a line

  - May only happen in Emacs-mac? yes
  - Repro: use C-n to move past, main-config.coffee line 21, then use C-p to
    move back, it will skip line 21
  - Repro: C-p skips first non-blank line after a blank line. See example.
  - Happens in Emacs-mac, both 24.2 and 24.3-rc1
  - Does not happen in Cocoa Emacs
  - Happens both when line-move-visual is nil and t
  - Happens in all modes
  - Happens with -nw from console
  - Does not happen with -nw -q from console. So what is causing it?
    - Not multiple-cursors, expand-region, or smart-forward

* TODO Colors on Emacs 23 on a console

  - Background face on transparent terminals is awful
  - install color-theme and choose one
  - magit is messed up
