  CLOSED: [2013-02-18 Mon 16:51]
  - https://gist.github.com/mads379/907245
  - trying: ctags -e -R --exclude=*.js --exclude=node_modules .
    but it doesn't do coffee, despite putting coffee definitions in .ctags and .etags
  - this command worked:
ctags -e -R --exclude=*.js --exclude=node_modules --exclude=local_notes \
--langdef=coffee \
--langmap=coffee:.coffee \
--regex-coffee="/^class ([A-Za-z.]+)( extends [A-Za-z.]+)?$/\1/c,class/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*@?([A-Za-z.]+):.*[-=]>.*$/\1/f,function/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=.*[-=]>.*$/\1/f,function/" \
--regex-coffee="/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=[^->\n]*$/\1/v,variable/" \
.

  - but only sort of. the definitions don't really work across modules and such.

* DONE Sometimes C-p and C-n skip a line                                :bug:
  CLOSED: [2013-05-19 Sun 15:13]

  - May only happen in Emacs-Mac-24.3? no, now also happens in Emacs-24.3
    - Happens in Emacs-Mac, both 24.2 and 24.3-rc1 and 24.3
    - Does not happen in Cocoa Emacs
    - Happens in emacsforosx.com 24.3
  - Repro: C-p skips first non-blank line after a blank line. See example.
    - Repro: use C-n to move past, main-config.coffee line 21, then use C-p to
    move back, it will skip line 21
    - Easiest: ./Emacs -Q, then visit ~/emacs-ctl-p-skip-lines-example
  - Conditions
    - Happens both when line-move-visual is nil and t
    - Happens in all modes
    - Happens with -nw from console
    - Does not happen with -Q from console
    - Does not happen with -nw -q from console. So what is causing it?
    -
    - Not multiple-cursors, expand-region, or smart-forward
    - it's fill-column-indicator
    - Happens with Emacs 24.3 from emacsforosx.com both -nw and windowed.
    - repro from -Q:
  - Obtain fill-column-indicator. I'm using version 20130126.1540 from Melpa.
  - (add-to-list 'load-path "/Users/william/.emacs.d/elpa/fill-column-indicator-20130126.1540/")
  - (require 'fill-column-indicator nil t)
  - Create new buffer in fundamental mode
  - M-x turn-on-fci-mode
  - Type the following until EOF, preserving newlines:

C-p will skip

C-p will land here
C-p will skip

Start here
EOF

1. Place cursor on "Start here" line, then hit C-p. Behavior will match what
   the text says.
2. describe-variable line-move-visual is nil
   - filed a bug https://github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator/issues/32
   - dup of https://github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator/issues/31
